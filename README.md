HTML Webpack Boilerplate
==========

This is an example HTML theme that includes:

- Webpack (using Laravel Mix)
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Autoprefixer

To modify it:

- Open a terminal, go to your theme folder and run `npm install` (node_modules folder will be created)
- Install more packages using `npm install --save`
- Require your installed packages in src/js/app.js
- Modify the js and scss files
- Run `npm run dev` (`npm run watch` to recompile when something changes)
- [Add new pages, partials, content files...]

When you are ready for production:

- Run `npm run prod`
- You don't need to upload `node_modules` and `src` folders to the production host if you don't compile your assets there

Enjoy!
